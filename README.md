# Adapter
This is an implementation of Adapter design pattern using C#.

## About example : 
First of all , The Clinet will send employees information in an Array string Form Which is acceptable by Interface Target. 
On the other hand we have ThirdPartyBillingSystem which will Process employees salary in a list of employess Form. We have to Convert string array into list form so we can seposit employees salary ! 
And this is what our ADAPTER exactly going to do.
